# Assignment 3 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment completes our movie chatbot system by implementing action functions that query our movie database and building a natural language interface. You implemented functions to search for movies by year, director, and actors, as well as the core search system that matches user queries to appropriate database operations. This builds directly on the pattern matching work from Assignment 2 to create a functional conversational AI system.

## What to complete
1. Complete all action functions in `a3.py` (title_by_year, title_by_year_range, etc.)
2. Implement the `search_pa_list` function to handle pattern matching and responses  
3. Add at least one new movie to the database with proper formatting
4. Create a new pattern/action pair and add it to the pa_list
5. Ensure all provided assert statements pass
6. Complete the reflection questions below
7. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions

1. What are some key programming concepts or techniques that you learned while completing this assignment?
Some key programming concepts or tequniques that I learnt while completing this assignment is getting more familiar with what users want and how we can make it happen. The way it reads what you are looking for and searches through the database. And the way the functions work when extracting information from the user and the way that it works when you're trying to find it in code to give the user the answer that it wants.


2. How does the overall movie chatbot system work? Explain the flow from when a user types a query to when they receive an answer.

The user types in something that they want to find out and then the system will read what you wrote and it will go through it's database to find something that matches what you are looking for. After that it will put together all the information that it needs to give you your answer.


3. What are some real-world applications where this type of pattern-matching chatbot system could be useful? How might you extend or improve this system for practical use?

Some real world applications where this type of of pattern-matching chatbot system would be useful is like at a fast food restaurant where someone is going to place an oline order of what they want and we can use a chatbot to help place their order in a more faster and sufficient way. I would help imporive this system by being able to understand a broader kind of language where the chat bot understands other uncommon words like slangs and misspelled words, because I think misspelling is a common human mistake that might be a conflict to the chatbot.
